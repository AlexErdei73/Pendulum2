## Pendulum2

The project is written to compare the movement of two identical pendulum started with slightly different initial
conditions. Bot pendulum has linear damping torque on them and a periodic driving torque. More information is available
in the [Physics Simulation Manual](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/javamanual.pdf) on page 57.
